##Hi, I'm Amanda.

####I enjoy cooking and trying as many new recipes as I can. I love watching animal .gifs over and over. I have tons (but not enough) of craft supplies and like to make, or attempt to make, all things. I'm also learning to code! Python, Markdown, Ruby, and Ruby on Rails. 

###I'm hoping to share my hobbies, inspire and teach. 

####Want your Twitter feed filled with animal pictures (and maybe some Metro rants)? Follow [me](http://twitter.com/ajzapata)!
