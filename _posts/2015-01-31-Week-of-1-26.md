###Welcome to my NEW blog.   

As I'm learning my way around using Jekyll and Markdown (and also becoming super familiar with GitHub, my terminal, and Sublime Text), I figured I would create my first post with two of my favorite things. Animals and food.

On Sundays I **love** to make new recipes. I have plenty of time to work in the kitchen, and it's nice to make something a little more *extravagant* to start the week. I also try to find new things to cook during the week to keep it interesting. I'm definitely not the type of person who could eat chicken and veggies every single day. 

I was also recently gifted with a stand mixer and I try to incorporate that in my recipes - **EVEN** if that means making 1000 cupcakes. Who cares about sugar intake?

I also spend a lot of time searching for new animal gifs. Animals are the **BEST**. Below are some gifs for your enjoyment (remember when FYE was a thing?).

- This pug getting owned by his own legs [here](http://i.imgur.com/25Wh4M1.gif).

- And if you haven't seen [this](http://i.imgur.com/ynA3IEy.gif) otter yet you are missing out.

- Also, [otters](http://www.thinknice.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Adorable-Otter.gif) are the greatest/cutest/I want one. 

So for some pictures of what I've been eating and making recently:
