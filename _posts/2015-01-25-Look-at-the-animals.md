#####Welcome to my NEW blog.   

As I'm learning my way around using Jekyll and Markdown (and also becoming super familiar with GitHub, my terminal, and Sublime Text), I figured I would create my first post with two of my favorite things. Animals and food.

On Sundays I **love** to make new recipes. I have plenty of time to work in the kitchen, and it's nice to make something a little more *extravagant* to start the week. I also try to find new things to cook during the week to keep it interesting. I'm definitely not the type of person who could eat chicken and veggies every single day. 

I was also recently gifted with a stand mixer and I try to incorporate that in my recipes - **EVEN** if that means making 1000 cupcakes. Who cares about sugar intake?

I also spend a lot of time searching for new animal gifs.
